# Resume Builder


## Project Description

Resume Builder simplifies the resume creation process with its intuitive Windows Forms application. Developed as a school project, this app is my first exposure to exporting files using C#.

Please be aware that this project requires Visual Studio with .NET desktop development installed for execution, as no standalone executable file is provided. Simply open the project within Visual Studio to begin playing.

## Features:

- User-friendly interface built with Windows Forms.
- Easily generate a professional resume by completing a simple form.
- Export your resume as a polished PDF file.
